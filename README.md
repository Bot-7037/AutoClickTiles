# AutoClickTiles
_____
## Story

Again I was getting bored so I started surfing the internet and came across a flash game [`White Tile 2`](http://www.crazygames.com/game/white-tile-2-don-t-tap-it)
I played the game a little bit until I got bored and ended up making an autockicker for the game

## Requirements
- The package should work like a charm, but the only flaw is that it is slow to open. 
- To get better opening time, just run the [python file](./PianoTiles.py).
