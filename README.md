# AutoClickTiles

## Story

I was getting bored so I started surfing the internet and came across a flash game [`White Tile 2`](http://www.crazygames.com/game/white-tile-2-don-t-tap-it)
I played the game a little bit until I got bored and ended up making an autockicker for the game

Just run the [`python file`](./PianoTiles.py).
